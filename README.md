# ML-Algorithms-in-Python
Machine Learning classification and regression algorithms coded for the Spring 2023 Machine Learning course at Johns Hopkins. Algorithms are coded "from scratch", i.e. using only Pandas, NumPy, and built-in libraries.

## Decision Trees

## Neural Networks

This folder contains classes for single-layer, multi-layer, and autoencoder neural networks for both classification and regression tasks. The models.py module contains abstract classifier and regressor parent classes.
